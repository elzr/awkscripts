Some miscellaneous awk scripts

(improvements welcomed)

chart.awk - take the first field and use that to draw a bar chart in front of each line
quantize.awk - output similar to the dtrace "quantize" function (useful buckets with graph)
table.awk - draw an ascii table sized appropriately with the fields from the input
